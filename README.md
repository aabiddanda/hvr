# `hvr`: a method for detection of hyper-variable regions in nematode genomes

## Method 

The core idea behind the method is to provide a model-driven method to isolate "hyper-divergent" loci from a collection of nematode individuals. The model is broader and can be applied to a larger number of contexts as well.

Briefly, we describe our method
